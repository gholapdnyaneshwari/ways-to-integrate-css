    <p>Learning CSS is an essential step in becoming a confident web designer or developer, because it gives you the
        power to control how every element on a webpage looks and behaves. With CSS, you can style text, arrange
        layouts, add colors, create responsive designs, and bring visual polish to otherwise plain HTML. As you
        practice, you start to see how small changes in selectors, properties, or values can dramatically transform a
        page’s appearance. Though it may feel tricky at first—especially when dealing with positioning or cascading
        rules—consistent practice and experimentation quickly build intuition. Over time, CSS becomes a creative toolkit
        that lets you express ideas visually and craft engaging user experiences.
